# Slow API Challenge

In the "slowApi.js" file you will find the completion of a memoize function that return the fastest answer between a slow function and a cache retrieve function. Because the slow function (that retrieves data from the data source) is always called, the cache must be updated each time.

*This project is a technical test*

## Assumptions
The asynchronous cache_retrieve, cache_store and slow_functions functions are assume to exist. <br>
<br>

*The "FullExample.js" file was just my playground for this project*
