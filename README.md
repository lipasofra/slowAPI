# MathBirthdays

This SPA helps you calculate your math brithday. You just need to enter your year, month and day of your birth date. Future dates are not allowed.

*This project is a technical test*

## What is that

The math brithday is a date where you would have a power of ten days (10<sup>n</sup>) after the day you were born.
So this app will tell you how many days and the date of your next math birthday!

### Techonologies
This SPA was build using React.js and is hosted online.
